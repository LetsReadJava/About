# Lets Read Java - A Code Reading Group 

A group of people who love to read code, inspired by the talk [Lets review code together](https://media.ccc.de/v/rc3-2021-cwtv-228-lets-review-code-toget) by [khaleesicodes](https://github.com/khaleesicodes) and [stoeckmann](https://github.com/stoeckmann).


We are still in an early phase, but we already had our first meetings and are planning to continue on a regular basis. Our focus is on the [Java programming language](https://www.java.com/en/).



We usually meet on Tuesday 17:00 CE(S)T in our [Jitsi room](https://jitsi.hamburg.ccc.de/JavaCodeReadingGroup) and are currently reviewing the [Spring (Core) Framework](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework) project.


If you would like to join, don't hesitate to reach out in the [discussions](https://github.com/LetsReadJava/About/discussions).
